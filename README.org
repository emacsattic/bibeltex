#+TITLE: BibELTeX README
* BibELTeX
  BibELTeX is a [[http://www.bibtex.org/][BibTeX]]-like tool for GNU Emacs' [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]].  Instead of generating
  TeX instructions BibELTeX generates org-mode data.

  This is intended as a replacement for =ox-bibtex.el= from org-mode's
  contrib.  Which is similar but only works for LaTeX and HTML export by using
  =bibtex2html=.

  This is in a very early development stage and currently does not produce any
  fancy or beautiful output.
* Installation
  Put =bibeltex.el= somewhere in your =load-path= and require it.  To
  deactivate it, simply call =unload-feature= for =bibeltex=.

  Use =\cite{key}= to add a citation and add a line

#+BEGIN_SRC org
#+BIBLIOGRAPHY file style
#+END_SRC

  to generate the bibliography.  With =file= being the name of a
  BibTeX-file. Currently =style= is being ignored.
* To Do
** TODO Style format
   Using a =format-spec= like format is not ideal.
** TODO More styles
   Add more styles (similar to bibtex styles).
** TODO Local customization
   Maybe: Support for =ox-bibtex.el= options
   Properties? Keywords?
** TODO Handle (La)TeX instructions
   E.g., umlauts with =\"{o}=.  Some things are handled by org-mode's entity
   support.  But sadly not everything.
** TODO Try to use org-mode internal functions to handle \cite/#+BIBLIOGRAPHY
   Currenty \cite/#+BIBLIOGRAPHY are expanded in any case.

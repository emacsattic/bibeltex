* Example file for BibELTeX

The bibliography data is stored in [[file:example.bib][example.bib]].  The file is in BibTeX format.
You can add citations by using \=cite{key,...}=.

E.g., some text\cite{Example1} or even multiple\cite{Example1,Example2}.

A good way to understand what's going on is to use org's org export.  Load
=ox-org.el= and press =C-c C-e O O= to see the org output in a buffer.

To generate a Bibliography add =#+BIBLIOGRAPHY= =example plain=.

Like so:

#+BIBLIOGRAPHY: example plain
